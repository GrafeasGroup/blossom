<p>
    <strong>Unescaped subreddit name</strong>: It looks like there are unescaped subreddit names,
    i.e. `r/subreddit` or `/r/subreddit`. Unfortunately, this might give the sub's mod a notification and could annoy them.

<p>
   Please escape the subreddit name with a backslash (`\\`), for example `r\\/subreddit` or `\\/r/subreddit`."

    <strong>Unescaped username</strong>: It looks like there are unescaped usernames,
    i.e. `u/username` or `/u/username`. Unfortunately, this gives the user a notification and might annoy them.
</p>
<p>
   Please escape the username with a backslash (`\\`), for example `u\\/username` or `\\/u/username`.

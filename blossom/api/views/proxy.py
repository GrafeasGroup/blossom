    """Retrieve images for OpenSeaDragon from Reddit's image host.

    Reddit does not set the appropriate CORS headers on their image host so that
    images can be pulled using AJAX (which is what OpenSeaDragon uses). The only ways
    to get around this are:

    a) ask Reddit politely to add the correct headers
    b) don't load the image at all
    c) proxy requests to i.redd.it through our own server, which doesn't have the same
       restrictions that the browser does

    Usage:

    GET .../api/iredditproxy/abcde.jpg
    The above request will load https://i.redd.it/abcde.jpg, then serve it from our
    server so that OpenSeaDragon can load it. Normally it would probably be reasonable
    to implement this in nginx instead of Django, but 1) I don't see this being that
    much of an issue and 2) doing it this way means that we can use it on local dev as
    well.
